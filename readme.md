## 1. Environment Setup

Open a terminal / console in the location where you checked out the code, for ease we will call this the 'project root'.

This will create a fresh repository that will eventually be linked up to the gyro source control system

#### Install NPM Packages

* run `npm install` from the console in the root of the project

## 2. Configuration

#### Config files 

Most of the configuration files are in the `.ignite` folder. The project defaults are generally good for prototyping or even most small websites. If you need to edit the defaults you should open `configuration.js` and edit the values contained in that file:
